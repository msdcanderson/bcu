## Survey logic file

An important option that helps you create and easily maintain complex surveys is Survey Logic File.

Throughout development and testing of the survey, and before activating it, it is very important to validate the survey logic. This is especially true when you use complex relevance, tailoring, and validation equations - you need to be sure that nothing will break when you run the survey.

This feature lets you quickly validate the accuracy of your survey, group(s), and question(s). [Link](https://manual.limesurvey.org/Show_logic_file).
