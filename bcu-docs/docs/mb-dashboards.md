## Syncing

### Scanning for field values

When Metabase first connects to your database, it takes a look at the metadata of the fields in your tables and automatically assigns them a field type. Metabase also takes a sample of each table to look for URLs, JSON, encoded strings, etc. If a field is classified wrong, you can always manually edit it from the Metadata tab in the Admin Panel.

By default, Metabase also performs a more intensive daily sampling of each fieldâ€™s values and caches the distinct values in order to make checkbox and select filters work in dashboards and SQL/native questions.

Note: Please contact us before making any changes in the 'Database' form this will lose the connection to the DB and break the charts.
