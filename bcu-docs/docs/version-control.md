## Version control

The survey can be [downloaded](https://manual.limesurvey.org/Display/Export_survey) (exported) in *.lss format.

The survey we developed has ID: 692579.  This survey is stored in a private GitLab repository and any corrections/updates are committed.  It can be considered the 'Master' template.  Q3 needs to be modified when the survey is run outside of the West Midlands.

When a new survey is needed, we can either duplicate a survey on LimeSurvey, or we can take the stored version.

If any changes are made to the survey that are likely to be needed on any future surveys, please let us know and we will commit a copy of the survey to the repository.
